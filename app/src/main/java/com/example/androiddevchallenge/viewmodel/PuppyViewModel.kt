Sami's Momma is a Black Mouth Cur mix, but since we never met his Dad, we can't be sure what breed mix Sami is.  Sami was born in a kill shelter and we got him out as soon we received the plea to help him.  Fortunately, that was before any harm came to Sami.  Sami is now living large in his foster home, but he is looking forward to starting the rest of his life in his own forever home. If you would like to live your life with Sami, please adopt it."
